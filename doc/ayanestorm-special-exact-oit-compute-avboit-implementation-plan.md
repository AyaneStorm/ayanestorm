# Exact OIT compute sorting and AVBOIT implementation plan

## Status

In progress. The lossless compute sorter passed its first build/runtime gate:
mode 9 proves live compute dispatch and visual parity, but the observed gain was
only about one FPS. It remains default-disabled. AVBOIT is now the active
implementation stage. Revision v27 contains the first wired prototype: it
reuses complete Exact OIT capture as a fallback-safe input, bypasses sorting,
builds adaptive occupancy, warp, extinction, and transmittance in compute, and
resolves unsorted nodes approximately.

The initial v18 build exposed and safely fell back from a GLSL 4.20 loader
selection for the AVBOIT compute source. V19 requires GLSL 4.30 for every
compute stage.

The initial active resolve exposed severe hair striping from unnormalized
same-slice color sums. V20 uses front-transmittance-weighted average color with
one exact aggregate-opacity application per pixel.

The remaining localized voxel blocks in hair led to v21: integrated
transmittance is now a filterable `R32F` volume sampled trilinearly during
resolve. This targets coarse-cell and physical-slice boundaries without
increasing the fixed one-eighth spatial resolution.

The SIGGRAPH 2025 AVBOIT presentation showed that filtered sampling must be
paired with linear extinction splatting and a camera-side sampling bias to
avoid self-occlusion. V22 splits each extinction contribution across adjacent
warped slices and samples front transmittance with the documented two-slice
bias.

V23 corrects opaque-scene glow behind transparency: screen alpha carries glow,
so it must be attenuated by total transmittance just like opaque RGB rather
than copied unchanged.

V24 uses a bounded hybrid resolve for shallow ordinary transparency. Lists of
at most 16 source-over or glow-only nodes are sorted and composited exactly;
deeper and custom-blend pixels continue through AVBOIT. This targets thin hair
and clothing layers without applying exact sorting to dense smoke pixels.

V25 raises that threshold to 32 after runtime testing showed a clothing surface
became stable only when close enough for its per-pixel depth to fall below 16.
The larger private array requires explicit performance validation.

V26 adds live branch diagnostic `RenderAVBOITDebugMode=1`: green identifies
captured pixels using the shallow exact branch and magenta identifies pixels
using approximate AVBOIT.

V27 corrects shallow-branch screen alpha so it contains only ordered,
glass-attenuated glow. It no longer restores unattenuated opaque glow or maps
ordinary accumulated opacity into the glow channel.

## Lossless Exact OIT compute sorter

- Extend the shader loader for program-local OpenGL compute shaders.
- Compact pixels with lists longer than one node through a 16-by-16 compute
  classification pass.
- Sort linked-list blocks of up to 64 nodes with one 64-lane workgroup and a
  fixed shared-memory bitonic network.
- Preserve the existing depth-descending and allocation-index-ascending total
  order.
- Apply the existing lossless opaque cutoff before block sorting.
- Ping-pong unfinished pixels through GPU-generated indirect queues while
  natural-run merge passes finish deep lists.
- Retain the existing fullscreen fragment sorter as the live and automatic
  fallback.
- Keep synchronous overflow validation and same-frame complete vanilla fallback.
- Add `RenderExactOITComputeSort`, default `false`.

Implemented in shader-cache revision v17. Diagnostic mode 9 displays green on
captured pixels when compute sorting was used and red when the fullscreen
fallback was used. State changes also log requested, available, and used flags.
Runtime testing confirmed the switching and visual parity, but not a significant
performance gain.

Promotion to default-enabled requires at least 25 percent lower Exact OIT
composite GPU time and 10 percent lower whole-frame GPU time in the deep-smoke
benchmark, with no avatar regression above 5 percent.

## Approximate AVBOIT renderer

- Implement the renderer in a separate `fsavboit` module.
- Add `RenderAVBOIT`, default `false`; AVBOIT takes precedence, then Exact OIT,
  then vanilla transparency.
- Require OpenGL and GLSL 4.3; fall back to Exact OIT after shader or resource
  failure.
- Use one-eighth viewport dimensions, 128 physical depth slices, and an 8K
  adaptive depth-occupancy/warp domain.
- Rasterize extinction, build the adaptive warp, integrate transmittance,
  render attenuated transparent color, and resolve over the opaque scene.
- Approximate all ordinary and custom color blends as source-over. Accumulate
  glow and emissive radiance additively with estimated front transmittance.
- Provide diagnostics for occupied depth, warp use, integrated transmittance,
  and zero-transmittance culling.

AVBOIT remains explicitly approximate and opt-in unless its visual differences
are accepted after smoke, splashes, foliage, hair, intersections, custom
particles, glow, and bright-background testing.

## Validation contract

- Exact compute output must match the existing Exact OIT sorter, including equal
  depths, custom blends, glow, cutoff toggles, GLTF, rigging, overflow, resize,
  and camera transitions.
- Repeated world entry and live setting changes must not reproduce the previous
  NVIDIA point-draw crashes.
- No exact-path node limit, silent discard, reduced resolution, or approximate
  fallback is allowed.
- The user performs builds and runtime tests; `bok`, `bokt`, crashes, images,
  and timings are recorded in the Exact OIT findings.
